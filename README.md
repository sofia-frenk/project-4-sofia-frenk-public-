## Project 4: Snail Gate Project

 This project is a fun project with three serious goals,
- To introduce thread programming,
- To show how condition-wait works,
- To show the techniques of data sharing between threads in a process. 

A draw thread is launched, which loops at a certain rate, incrementing the snail and drawing a picture of it, and a gate. 
The gate is either open and closed. If the gate is open when the snail arrives it passes through and eventually the game is won. 
Else the snail smushes against the gate and the game is lost.
